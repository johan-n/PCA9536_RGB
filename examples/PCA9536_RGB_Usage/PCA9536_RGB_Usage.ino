  PCA9536_RGB LIBRARY - USAGE EXAMPLE
  -----------------------------------

  INTRODUCTION
  ------------ 

  This sketch offers a complete usage illustration of how to use the PCA9536_RGB library.

  INPORTANT: The current library depends on the Arduino IDE's native 'Wire' library for I2C communication between the Arduino (Master) and the PCA9536 (Slave).

                       -------
                IO0 --| â€¢     |-- VCC
                      |       |
                IO1 --|       |-- SDA
                      |       |
                IO2 --|       |-- SCL
                      |       |
                GND --|       |-- IO3
                       -------

    This following hookup can be used with any Common-Anode RGB Led and the present sketch:

    PIN 1 (IO0) - Connect to Led's BLUE  pin via an appropriate resistor
    PIN 2 (IO1) - Connect to Led's GREEN pin via an appropriate resistor
    PIN 3 (IO2) - Connect to Led's RED   pin via an appropriate resistor
    PIN 4 (GND) - Connect to Arduino GND
    PIN 5 (IO3) - Connect to Arduino GND
    PIN 6 (SCL) - Connect to Arduino Pin A5 with a 2K2 (400MHz) or 10K (100MHz) pull-up resistor
    PIN 7 (SDA) - Connect to Arduino Pin A4 with a 2K2 (400MHz) or 10K (100MHz) pull-up resistor
    PIN 8 (VCC) - Connect to Arduino 5V output
    DECOUPING   - Connect a 0.1uF Ceramic Capacitor between the PCA9536's VCC & GND pins

    RGB LED COMMON-ANODE PIN - Connect to Arduino 5V output

    IMPORTANT: It is possible to connect any type of RGB Led (Commone-Anode / Common-Cathode)
               to any of the PCA9536's I/O pins (IO0, IO1, IO2, IO3), but then it is necessary
               to update the constructor's configuration accordingly in the sketch itself.

  I2C ADDRESS
  -----------
  The PCA9536 has a single I2C address (factory hardwired):
 
        PART               DEVICE I2C ADDRESS          PART
       NUMBER          (BIN)      (HEX)     (DEC)     MARKING
      --------        --------    -----     -----     -------
      PCA9536D        01000001    0x41       65       PCA9536

  Note: The 'D' suffix of the Part Number denotes the SOIC-8 package
