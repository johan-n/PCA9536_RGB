    PCA9536_RGB LIBRARY - USAGE EXAMPLE
    -----------------------------------

    INTRODUCTION
    ------------
    This sketch offers a simple code illustrating the use of the blink() function of the PCA9536_RGB library.

    The blinking function uses an ISR (Interrupt Service Routine) based on overflow of Arduino Timer 1 (not to
    be confused with the ISR used for monitoring the state of the push-button switch use below)

    INPORTANT: The current library depends on the Arduino IDE's native 'Wire' library for I2C communication between the Arduino (Master) and the PCA9536 (Slave).

               -------
        IO0 --| â€¢     |-- VCC
              |       |
        IO1 --|       |-- SDA
              |       |
        IO2 --|       |-- SCL
              |       |
        GND --|       |-- IO3
               -------

    This hookup can be used with the following sketch:

    PIN 1 (IO0) - Connect BLUE  pin of a Common-Anode RGB Led via appropriate series resistor
    PIN 2 (IO1) - Connect GREEN pin of a Common-Anode RGB Led via appropriate series resistor
    PIN 3 (IO2) - Connect RED   pin of a Common-Anode RGB Led via appropriate series resistor
    PIN 4 (GND) - Connect to Arduino GND
    PIN 5 (IO3) - Leave unconnected for the purpose of this sketch
    PIN 6 (SCL) - Connect to Arduino Pin A5 with a 2K2 (400MHz) or 10K (100MHz) pull-up resistor
    PIN 7 (SDA) - Connect to Arduino Pin A4 with a 2K2 (400MHz) or 10K (100MHz) pull-up resistor
    PIN 8 (VCC) - Connect to Arduino 5V output
    DECOUPING   - Connect a 0.1uF Ceramic Capacitor between the PCA9536's VCC & GND pins

    RGB LED COMMON-ANODE PIN - Connect to Arduino 5V output

    IMPORTANT: It is possible to connect any type of RGB Led (Commone-Anode / Common-Cathode)
               to any of the PCA9536's I/O pins (IO0, IO1, IO2, IO3), but then it is necessary
               to update the constructor's configuration accordingly in the sketch itself.
